# dog_breed_classifier
CNN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for our app. By completing this lab, I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.

If you'd like to use this notebook to do any re-training on the dataset you can grab it at the links below.
